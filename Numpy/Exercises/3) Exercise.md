# Statistical Operations in NumPy

## Task Description
In this exercise, you will perform **statistical operations** on a given NumPy array. You will compute the following:
- **Mean**: The average value of the array.
- **Median**: The middle value when the array is sorted.
- **Standard Deviation**: A measure of how spread out the numbers are.
- **Variance**: The square of the standard deviation, indicating data dispersion.

This task will help you understand how to apply statistical computations to numerical datasets using NumPy.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this exercise, you will:
- Learn how to calculate statistical metrics in NumPy.
- Understand how to analyze the spread and distribution of data.
- Improve your ability to work with NumPy's built-in functions for data analysis.
