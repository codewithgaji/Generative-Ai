# Indexing and Slicing in NumPy

## Task Description
In this exercise, you will create a **6x6 NumPy matrix** and perform the following operations:
- Extract a **3x3 sub-matrix** from its center.
- Replace the extracted sub-matrix with **zeros** in the original matrix.

This task will help you understand how to work with matrix indexing and slicing in NumPy.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this exercise, you will:
- Learn how to extract sub-matrices from larger matrices.
- Understand how to modify specific sections of an array.
- Improve your ability to work with multi-dimensional indexing in NumPy.
