# Sorting in NumPy

## Task Description
In this exercise, you will create a **5x5 NumPy array** filled with random integers between **10 and 100**. Then, you will:
- Sort each row in **ascending order**.
- Sort each column in **ascending order**.

This task will help you understand how to manipulate 2D arrays using sorting operations in NumPy.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this exercise, you will:
- Learn how to generate and manipulate 2D arrays in NumPy.
- Understand how to apply sorting operations to both rows and columns.
- Improve your proficiency in working with structured data in arrays.
