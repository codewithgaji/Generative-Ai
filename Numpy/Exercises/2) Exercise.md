# Create and Manipulate Arrays

## Task Description
In this exercise, you will create a **3x3 NumPy array** filled with random integers between **1 and 50**. Then, you will modify the array such that:
- **All even numbers are replaced with 0**
- **All odd numbers are replaced with 1**

This task will help you practice:
- Generating random numbers in NumPy
- Conditional element-wise operations
- Modifying NumPy arrays efficiently

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this exercise, you will:
- Gain a deeper understanding of NumPy array manipulation
- Learn how to apply conditional transformations to an array
- Improve your ability to work with numerical data efficiently
