# PyTorch Deep Learning ðŸ“š

Welcome to the **PyTorch Deep Learning** folder! ðŸš€

## Purpose
This folder is designed as a beginner-friendly resource for learning PyTorch, one of the most widely-used frameworks for deep learning and AI development. As I learn PyTorch, this repository will grow to include examples, concepts, and practical implementations.

Whether you're new to PyTorch or looking to strengthen your understanding, this folder is for you!

## What Youâ€™ll Learn
This folder covers the foundational skills and concepts required to work with PyTorch, starting from the basics and moving toward creating deep learning models. Key topics include:

- **Tensors**: Learn the core data structure in PyTorch and how to use it for numerical computations.
- **Simple Neural Networks**: Understand how to build, train, and evaluate basic neural networks.
- **Operations on Tensors**: Perform mathematical and logical operations on tensors.
- **Model Training**: Explore the process of training neural networks, including backpropagation and optimization.
- **Future Topics (Coming Soon)**: Dive deeper into advanced topics such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and custom loss functions.

## Structure
This folder contains the following resources:

1. **Tensors.ipynb**: An introduction to tensors, including their creation, operations, and applications.
2. **Simple Neural Network.ipynb**: A step-by-step guide to building and training a basic neural network with PyTorch.

More notebooks and resources will be added as I progress in my learning journey.
