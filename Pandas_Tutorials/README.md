# Pandas Tutorials

This folder contains tutorials and examples that showcase the **uses of Pandas** in data manipulation, analysis, and preparation.

## Why Learn Pandas?

Pandas is a powerful and flexible library in Python that simplifies working with structured data. It is especially essential if you are documenting or planning to learn **Generative AI**, as it plays a vital role in preparing data for AI models.

### Uses of Pandas:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent formatting.
- **Data Transformation**: Reshape, filter, and aggregate data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform statistical operations, grouping, and time-series analysis.
- **Integration with AI**: Prepare datasets for Generative AI models by formatting data into a usable structure.

### Why is it Necessary for Generative AI?

Generative AI relies heavily on well-prepared datasets to learn patterns and generate meaningful outputs. Pandas is a must-have tool for:

- Ensuring the quality and structure of input data.
- Creating insights from large datasets.
- Working seamlessly with other libraries like NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

By mastering Pandas, youâ€™ll gain a strong foundation in data handlingâ€”an essential step in building powerful Generative AI models.

### Pandas vs. Python Dictionary: Why Pandas is Preferred

This section compares the functionality of Pandas and Python dictionaries, explaining why Pandas is a better choice for data manipulation and analysis.

## 1. Structured Data Representation

- **Dictionary**: Handles key-value pairs; suitable for simple data storage and retrieval.
- **Pandas**: Provides DataFrame and Series objects to work with structured tabular data, making it easier to organize and analyze datasets.

## 2. Performance

- **Dictionary**: Performance slows with large datasets; not optimized for numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: Built on NumPy, it handles large datasets efficiently with vectorized operations and better memory management.

## 3. Advanced Data Operations

- **Dictionary**: Basic operations require manual coding for filtering, aggregation, or transformations.
- **Pandas**: Comes with built-in tools for operations like `groupby`, merging, pivoting, and statistical computations.

## Filtering Data Using Pandas

This repository contains a notebook demonstrating data filtering and manipulation using Pandas. It covers key techniques for efficiently cleaning and analyzing data.

## Highlights

- **Logical Operations**: Use of `&` and `|` for combining multiple conditions.
- **Conditional Filtering**: Applying `<`, `>`, and other operators for filtering rows.
- **String Replacement**: Utilizing `str.replace` to modify column values.
- **Index Sorting**: Organizing data with `sort_index` for better readability.
- **Row and Column Selection**: Using `.loc` and `.iloc` for precise data slicing.


## Pandas Row and Column Updates

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to update rows and columns in a Pandas DataFrame. It covers the use of various functions and methods, including `apply()`, `applymap()`, `map()`, `rename()`, and `replace()`, to manipulate and transform data efficiently.

## Overview

The notebook explains the following steps:

1. **Testing with Small Data**: The methods are first tested on a small dataset created using Python's dictionary.
2. **Converting to DataFrame**: The dictionary is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame to perform more complex operations.
3. **Key Functions Explained**:
   - **`apply()`**: Apply a function along a specific axis (rows or columns) of the DataFrame.
   - **`applymap()`**: Apply a function element-wise to every value in the DataFrame.
   - **`map()`**: Transform elements in a Pandas Series by applying a function element-wise.
   - **`rename()`**: Rename the labels of the rows and columns in the DataFrame.
   - **`replace()`**: Replace specific values in the DataFrame with new values.

# Pandas Operations: Append and Delete Rows/Columns

Working with rows and columns in Pandas using `.append()` and `.drop()` methods. This Section provides you with easy-to-follow examples for your data manipulation tasks. Let's get started!

## Creating a DataFrame
Here's an example DataFrame to get started:
```python
# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```
**Output:**
```
      Name  Age           City
0    Alice   25      New York
1      Bob   30  Los Angeles
2  Charlie   35       Chicago
```

## Appending Rows
To append rows to your DataFrame, use `.append()` to combine an existing DataFrame with a new row or set of rows. This method creates a new DataFrame with the appended data and leaves the original DataFrame unchanged. If you're using Pandas 2.0 or later, `pd.concat()` is the recommended alternative to achieve the same result.

---

## Deleting Rows
The `.drop()` method allows you to remove specific rows by their index. You can delete a single row or multiple rows at once. The method provides the option to return a new DataFrame with the rows removed or to modify the existing DataFrame directly by setting `inplace=True`.

---

## Deleting Columns
With `.drop()`, you can also delete columns by specifying their names. This method is useful for removing unnecessary or redundant data from your DataFrame. Similar to deleting rows, you can choose to return a new DataFrame or modify the original one using `inplace=True`.

---

## Notes
- The `.append()` method does not modify the original DataFrame; it returns a new one. Use `inplace=True` if you want to modify the DataFrame in place.
- The `.drop()` method works similarly; it does not modify the original DataFrame unless `inplace=True` is specified.
- The `.append()` method is deprecated in Pandas 2.0. Instead, use `pd.concat()` for appending.


## Sorting Data in Pandas

This section provides a summary of various Pandas methods used for sorting data efficiently:

### 1. `sort_index()`
- Sorts data based on the index labels.
- Can be applied to rows (`axis=0`) or columns (`axis=1`).
- Includes options for ascending or descending order.

### 2. `sort_values()`
- Sorts data based on the values of one or more columns.
- Offers flexibility to handle multiple columns using the `by` parameter.
- Includes options for ascending or descending order, and for handling missing values.

### 3. `.nlargest()`
- Retrieves the top `n` largest values from a specified column.
- Particularly useful for filtering key insights from large datasets.

### 4. `.nsmallest()`
- Retrieves the top `n` smallest values from a specified column.
- Helps identify the lowest-ranking data points for analysis.

These methods enhance the process of organizing and analyzing data, making it easier to derive meaningful insights. Check the accompanying notebook for detailed examples and usage!

## Grouping and Aggregating in Pandas

Grouping and aggregating are powerful tools in pandas for summarizing and analyzing data.

### Grouping
- Use `.groupby()` to split the data into groups based on specific criteria or columns.
- Allows operations to be performed on each group independently.

### Aggregating
- Apply aggregation functions like `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.count()`, `.min()`, `.max()`, and more to summarize grouped data.
- Supports custom aggregation functions for tailored summaries.

### Key Features
- Combine multiple aggregation operations using `.agg()` for detailed analysis.
- Leverage `groupby()` with multiple keys to analyze complex relationships in data.

These tools make it easy to uncover insights and patterns in structured datasets.

## Final Thoughts
Learning is a gradual process. You donâ€™t need to know everything at once. Focus on understanding the basics first, and revisit concepts as needed.

**The goal is to have a solid foundation so you can move forward with learning more advanced libraries and concepts in Generative AI.** Even I constantly revisit concepts to refresh my memory. Take it slow, and remember: progress is better than perfection.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
