# Pandas Filtering Exercises

Welcome to the Pandas Filtering exercises! This repository contains exercises to help you understand and practice filtering rows in a Pandas DataFrame.

## Exercise 1: Filter Rows Where Age1stCode is Less Than 15

In this exercise, you will filter the dataset to show only the rows where the "Age1stCode" column is less than 15. This will help you analyze respondents who started coding at an exceptionally young age.

### Instructions:
1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Filter the rows where the "Age1stCode" column is less than 15.

### Expected Output:
The output should be a filtered DataFrame containing only rows where the value in the "Age1stCode" column is less than 15.

## Exercise 2: Filter Rows Based on Country and Converted Compensation

In this exercise, you will filter the dataset to find respondents who:
- Reside in the United States.
- Have a "ConvertedComp" greater than 100,000.

This will help you identify high earners from the United States in the dataset.

### Instructions:
1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Filter the rows where:
   - The "Country" column equals "United States".
   - The "ConvertedComp" column is greater than 100,000.

### Expected Output:
The output should be a filtered DataFrame containing rows that match both conditions.
