# Generative AI Learning Path

Welcome to my **Generative AI Learning Path** repository! ðŸš€

## Purpose
This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey in learning the foundational concepts and tools necessary for building and training AI models. By keeping track of my progress, I aim to provide a resource that others can also use to embark on their own learning journey.

## Why Follow Along?
The topics covered in this repository represent the building blocks of AI development. Mastering these will not only enhance your understanding of AI but also make training and building AI models more efficient. If you're interested in Generative AI or AI in general, this repository could be a great starting point for you!

## Roadmap for Learning

To follow this learning path effectively, I suggest going through the topics in the following sequence:

1. **Start with NumPy**  
   - **Why NumPy?** Learn how to work with multi-dimensional arrays, basic mathematical operations, and linear algebra. It's a fundamental tool for numerical computations in AI.
   - **Next Steps**: Once you're comfortable with NumPy, you'll be ready to manipulate and process data more efficiently using Pandas.

2. **Move on to Pandas**  
   - **Why Pandas?** Pandas is great for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis. It builds on your NumPy knowledge and lets you work with tabular data (DataFrames).
   - **Next Steps**: After mastering data handling with Pandas, you'll want to visualize your data to better understand patterns and trends.

3. **Learn Data Visualization with Matplotlib**  
   - **Why Matplotlib?** Visualization is key for understanding your data. You'll learn how to create meaningful plots and graphs that help with decision-making and model evaluation.
   - **Next Steps**: Once your data is visualized, it's time to apply machine learning techniques to draw insights.

4. **Dive into Scikit-learn**  
   - **Why Scikit-learn?** This library is essential for implementing machine learning algorithms and preprocessing tasks like feature scaling and encoding.
   - **Next Steps**: Once you're comfortable with Scikit-learn, it's time to explore deep learning and move on to PyTorch.

5. **Explore PyTorch**  
   - **Why PyTorch?** PyTorch is the go-to deep learning framework for building and training neural networks. Youâ€™ll learn about tensors, gradients, and model training using PyTorch's high-level APIs.
   - **Next Steps**: With your knowledge of PyTorch, you can begin building more complex AI models, including generative models.

## Topics Covered
Here are the key tools and topics you will find in this repository:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Tensors**: The core data structure for AI computations, used extensively in frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and model performance.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and handling multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.

 ## How to Use This Repository
- Check out the individual Jupyter Notebooks for each topic to learn concepts step-by-step.
- Follow along with the code and explanations to understand how each tool contributes to AI development.
- Experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.



## Final Thoughts
Learning is a gradual process. You donâ€™t need to know everything at once. Focus on understanding the basics first, and revisit concepts as needed.

**The goal is to have a solid foundation so you can move forward with learning more advanced libraries and concepts in Generative AI.** Even I constantly revisit concepts to refresh my memory. Take it slow, and remember: progress is better than perfection.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
