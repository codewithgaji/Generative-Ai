# Generative AI Learning Path

Welcome to my Generative AI Learning Path repository! ðŸš€

## Purpose
This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey in learning the foundational concepts and tools necessary for building and training AI models. By keeping track of my progress, I aim to provide a resource that others can also use to embark on their own learning journey.

## Why Follow Along?
The topics covered in this repository represent the building blocks of AI development. Mastering these will not only enhance your understanding of AI but also make training and building AI models more efficient. If you're interested in Generative AI or AI in general, this repository could be a great starting point for you!

## Topics Covered
Here are the key tools and topics you will find in this repository:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Tensors**: The core data structure for AI computations, used extensively in frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and model performance.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and handling multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.

## How to Use This Repository
- Check out the individual Jupyter Notebooks for each topic to learn concepts step-by-step.
- Follow along with the code and explanations to understand how each tool contributes to AI development.
- Experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.

## Contributions
